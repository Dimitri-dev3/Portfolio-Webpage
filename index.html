            <p> 
                My name is Dimitri Liapis and I love programming.
                My favorite thing about programming is the building aspect of it. 
                You put all of these little peices together to make something work. I especially
                like game devlopment and coding up the different functions and watching the characters
                and sprites move. It is like being digital Bob Ross! Even as a young gamer I would always
                question how the developer put together the game. Like how does the A 
                button have the ability to trigger 4 different Pokemon moves. Does it read the move name
                does the move hold data that plays once pressed. So this is how I would play games when I was younger
                and now that I am able to make games and that it is much more accessible than it was in 2004
                when I was 7, I love to develop games in my free time.

		2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
		3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
		4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
		5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
		6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
		7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
		8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
		9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

		BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
		  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
		  - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).
